# BETH Stack workshop

## Disclaimer

I got inspiration (read: blatantly copied the contents of this video, with a bit of my own flavour) from youtuber Ethan Niser at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24.

Just wanted to create a follow everything in a MarkDown file for my team at work to easily copy and paste the code without having to type everything. Watch the video, it is all explained there as well I don't want to take credit for this whatsoever.

## DevContainer

Using Docker and the devcontainer plugin in visual studio code you can easily setup a container do this workshop in. Even users on windows can now do this.

## BETH Stack

So what is the BETH Stack and why do we want to use it?

Well this stack uses the tools and technologies explained below as well as some others that we will go through in the workshop itself (but are not as important to put in the acronym).

For why do we want to use it, it is fun to try out new technologies. See what they do and how they work. We will probably never use this in our day to day jobs at least I don't think so. But this does not mean we can't have a little bit of fun to try out these technologies.

### BUN

Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called bunâ€‹.

At its core is the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.

Sounds like a bold statement and for those who have not followed the discussions online for this, the verdict is not yet complete. Nevertheless we are going to play around with it. You can find more information on their website https://bun.sh/.

### Elysia

Ergonomic Framework for Humans

TypeScript framework supercharged by Bun with End-to-End Type Safety, unified type system and outstanding developer experience

Sounds like express, but then for humans? Anyway it is quite new and as it states it is supercharged by Bun we want to use it right. You can find also more information on this at https://elysiajs.com/

### Turso / sqllite

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.
The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep it that way through the year 2050. SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems and as a long-term archival format for data. There are over 1 trillion (1e12) SQLite databases in active use.

This is not new, but very useful for proof-of-concepts and comes out of the box with Bun. For more information on how bun uses it https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite or the documentation itself https://www.sqlite.org/index.html.

Turso is an edge-hosted, distributed database based on libSQL, an open-source and open-contribution fork of SQLite. It was designed to minimize query latency for applications where queries come from anywhere in the world. In particular, it works well with edge functions provided by cloud platforms such as CloudFlare, Netlify, and Vercel, by putting your data geographically close to the code that accesses it.

This sounds interesting, let's just use it. Due to the length of this course this is the last part and only if we have time for this.
For more information please check out https://turso.tech/.

### HTMX

htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext.

Sounds cool but why would we want this if we have javascript and rest?

Well their motivation is:

- Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
- Why should only `click` & `submit` events trigger them?
- Why should only `GET` & `POST` methods be available?
- Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext. You can find more information about this on https://htmx.org/.

Now let's see how we set all these up and actually build an application with this. Sorry this is going to be another Todo app all over again, but with blazingly fast startup times and less memory usage.

## Setup BUN

To make sure we can run our application in bun we need to setup a server in bun and make sure this architecture runs on our machines. This part will cover installing and setting up our server using only bun.

### Installing BUN

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Setup server

First we need to tell bun to init in the folder we want to create our application in by executing the following command in the root and go through all the questions

```bash
mkdir chapter-workshop-beth && cd chapter-workshop-beth
bun init
```

```bash
bun init helps you get started with a minimal project and tries to guess sensible defaults. Press ^C anytime to quit
package name (chapter-workshop-beth):
entry point (index.ts):

Done! A package.json file was saved in the current directory.
+ index.ts
+ .gitignore
+ tsconfig.json (for editor auto-complete)
```

This sets up everything for us to start our bun server. We can run the server now with the `run` command.

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

Running this should show a log line on the command line with `Hello via Bun!` (or something like this, it should not show any errors).

#### Watch/Hot

We can also watch our files so we don't have restart our server if we change our ts / tsx (later) files with the `--watch` or `--hot` argument.

```bash
bun run --watch index.ts
bun run --hot index.ts
```

Having setup bun we can continue with the next step for our application.
For this we are going to add Elysia in the mix.

## Use Elysia

We are going to use Elysia to serve our html(x) content and setup our other routes for `GET`, `POST` or any other method. First we have to add this to our application and then we can setup our routes for our application.

### Add Elysia

We can simply add Elysia using bun with the command below.

```bash
bun add elysia
```

See how fast bun actually installs this, is this not amazing (compared to NODE that is)?

To add it to our application we need to open index.ts and change the entire content to the following:

```typescript
import { Elysia } from "elysia";

const app = new Elysia().get("/", () => "Hello world from Elysia").listen(3000);
console.log(
  `Elysia is running at http://${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`
);
```

After we saved our file, we can now run our new application using the `run` command again or if you have used the `watch` or `hot` argument it should automatically have reloaded.

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

It should now display the following log line on the command line.

```bash
Elysia is running at http://localhost:3000
```

We have successfully added Elysia to our application. We can double check this by going to http://localhost:3000 (or any port that you put in) and it should show you Hello World from Elysia.

Sadly we are not able to server html yet at this moment with Elysia, if you try to add html as output it will just show up as text on the browser (try this if you don't believe me). For this we need to add another plugin/library (welcome to front-end land, where we can just add another plugin or library for everything).

### Add html to Elysia

To add the html plugin for Elysia so we can actually display html (this is important for the last part htmx) we need to add the html plugin.

```bash
bun add @elysia/html
```

To make sure this works we are going to add a constant base html variable to our index.ts file and use this.

Make sure we can use the html functionality within our application, to do this we add the following import statement to the top of our file.

```typescript
import { html } from "@elysiajs/html";
```

Add the constant base html variable at the end of the file (or anywhere you like, something about hoisting right?).

```typescript
const baseHtml = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<title>Chapter Workshop</title>
</head>
<body><h1>Hello World from Elysia Dom!</h1> I am a html document </body>
</html > `;
```

Now we can update the router on the app to display this baseHtml variable by changing the router code to the following.

```typescript
const app = new Elysia()
  .use(html())
  .get("/", ({ html }) => html(baseHtml))
  .listen(3000);
```

From now on I am going to assume you have used the `watch` or `hot` parameters if not you have to rerun the `run` command everytime we look at the webpage otherwise your changes will not be reflected.
So when we look at http://localhost:3000 it should show our html page as a html page and not just all the tags as text.

Now we want to use templating right? Makes our lives a lot easier for this we again need to drop in another dependency (plugin/library).

### Bring in typed-html

We are adding typed-html to this so we can create templates, so it is easier to maintain if we can create our own components and not have to write the same html code every time.
To do so we want to add typed-html as a devDependency with the command below.

```bash
bun add -d typed-html
```

Again just marvel in the speed bun offers us here.

Then we want to adjust our tsconfig.json file to use the following two lines (if they exists replace them otherwise add them in the compilerOptions object).

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react",
    "jsxFactory": "elements.createElement"
  }
}
```

Although we're configuring the compiler to use React, this is not what is being used. Instead, we redirect all jsx element to typed-html's elements.createElement.

We do have to rename our index.ts to index.tsx.

```bash
mv index.ts index.tsx
```

We also have to make sure we use this new file in our run command.

```bash
bun run --watch index.tsx
```

In our index.tsx file we now have to add our just added dev dependency using an import statement.

```typescript
import * as elements from "typed-html";
```

Now we are going to change our baseHtml variable to be a component and use templating. Change the current `const baseHtml` variable in your code to the following.

```javascript
const BaseHtml = ({ children }: elements.Children) => `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<title>Chapter Workshop</title>
</head>
${children}
</html > `;
```

We now made it a function accepting a list of children (html objects) to display after the head tag and returning this.

To use this new `BaseHtml` component we have to update our `GET /` route to the following.

```javascript
.get("/", ({ html }) => html(
  <BaseHtml>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello World from Elysia Dom!</h1> I am a html document with a component.
    </body>
  </BaseHtml>
))
```

We changed the html to use the `<BaseHtml>` tag and added plain html (as a child, whoo xml sytnax).

When looking at http://localhost:3000 (assuming you restarted the server with the new .tsx file) this should reflect the changes we made.

We now are ready to use Bun to create our application and run our Elysia server to serve our html components and templates. Now it is time to add htmx into this brewing pot we call an application.

## Introducing HTMX

### Adding HTMX

Now that we have setup our application to serve html components and templates it is time to add htmx.

We will add the following to our BaseHtml component between the <head></head> tag.

```html
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.5"
  integrity="sha384-xcuj3WpfgjlKF+FXhSQFQ0ZNr39ln+hwjN3npfM9VBnUskLolQAcN80McRIVOPuO"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

#### Extra

There is a vs-code extension called htmx-tags, no idea if it actually works
because I have not tried it yet.

We can now use all the goodies htmx has to offer us on our components. Let's try them out.

### HTMX Test

In the body of our BaseHTML component we are going to create a button with a hx-post function. We are going to use hx-swap to replace the target (button) element with the returning response (swap the entire thing, which is done with the outerHTML). If you want to know more about hx-swap visit https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/.

```html
<BaseHtml>
  <body>
    <button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</BaseHtml>
```

Now we need to add the `POST /clicked` to our router to create the response with html to replace the button.

```javascript
.post("/clicked", () => (
  <div>Now I am a div and not a button anymore returned from the server</div>
))
```

Now it should work on http://localhost:3000. It should display the button we created and when clicking it, it should show the div we added.

#### Adding some css (but don't make it too hard because we are ING developers and not used to css)

For this we are going to use tailwindcss (https://tailwindcss.com/) and they also have a nice import which we can add between our <head></head> tags.  
**Note:Don't use in a production environment.**  
Below you can find the script tag we want to add to the content of our baseHtml variable, below the htmx include script.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

After adding this script tag we included tailwindcss and we can use it to add css classes to our components and/or page (play around with this as much
as you like).  
Further on there are css classes included in the components, you can ofcourse use your own as well if you really like so.

```html
<body class="flex w-full h-screen justify-center items-center">
  <button class="border rounded" hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
    Click Me
  </button>
</body>

<div class="text-blue-600">
  Now I am a div and not a button anymore returned from the server
</div>
```

Now we should see the css in action. Our file up until now looks like the following.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { html } from "@elysiajs/html";
import * as elements from "typed-html";

const app = new Elysia()
  .use(html())
  .get("/", ({ html }) =>
    html(
      <BaseHtml>
        <body class="flex w-full h-screen justify-center items-center">
          <button class="border rounded" hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
            Click Me
          </button>
        </body>
      </BaseHtml>
    )
  )
  .post("/clicked", () => (
    <div class="text-blue-600">
      Now I am a div and not a button anymore returned from the server
    </div>
  ))
  .listen(3000);
console.log(
  `Elysia is running at http://${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`
);

const BaseHtml = ({ children }: elements.Children) => `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.5" integrity="sha384-xcuj3WpfgjlKF+FXhSQFQ0ZNr39ln+hwjN3npfM9VBnUskLolQAcN80McRIVOPuO" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<title>Chapter Workshop</title>
</head>
${children}
</html> `;
```

## Let's create a todo app

Now we have all our tools and libraries in place (well we don't have a database yet, but we will get to this later) let's create our actual Todo Application.

### Add objects and components

To have todo's we need to have a todo type, we can add this to the bottom of the file below our baseHtml in our index.tsx file.

```typescript
type Todo = {
  id: number;
  content: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
```

Now our objects need to be saved somewhere (no, still not the database), so we are creating below our type our "database".

```typescript
const db: Todo[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: "Learn to create and setup the BETH stack.",
    completed: true,
  },
  { id: 2, content: "Create workshop", completed: true },
  { id: 3, content: "??", completed: false },
  { id: 4, content: "profit", completed: false },
];
```

We have our "database" and our type, now we can create our todo component and todo list component. We can add these below our "database" code.

```typescript
function TodoItem({ content, completed, id }: Todo) {
  return (
    <div class="flex flex-row space-x-3">
      <p>{content}</p>
      <input type="checkbox" checked={completed} />
      <button class="text-red-500">X</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function TodoList({ todos }: { todos: Todo[] }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <TodoItem {...todo} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now we need to display this on the front end. We can actually get our body to load this using htmx and should look like the below code.

```html
<BaseHtml>
  <body
    class="flex w-full h-screen justify-center items-center"
    hx-get="/todos"
    hx-trigger="load"
    hx-swap="innerHTML"
  />
</BaseHtml>
```

This does a few things:

- It uses hx-get to do a `GET /todos` call (you can check this network tab).
- This call it is triggered when the body component is loaded.
- Then swaps the entire innerHTML with the received response.

To checkout other triggers please visit (https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/).  
Now because we are calling the `GET /todos` resource we need to add this in our router (By now I am assuming you know how to add this to the router, if not ask).

```typescript
.get("/todos", async () => {
    return <TodoList todos={db} />;
})
```

You can view the result at http://localhost:3000/

### CRUD

Now we are going to create the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality.

#### Update

Why not start with update it is only 3rd in the acronym, create is really hard and we already have read sort of.  
To be able to toggle whether or not a todo is actually done we need to create a `POST /todos/toggle/:id` route.
Let's add this to our router as below.

```typescript
.post(
  "/todos/toggle/:id",
    ({ params }) => {
      const todo = db.find((todo) => todo.id === params.id);
      if (todo) {
        todo.completed = !todo.completed;
        return <TodoItem {...todo} />;
      }
    },
    {
      params: t.Object({
        id: t.Numeric(),
      }),
    }
)
```

We introduced a few new things here let's explain them. The additional argument/object in the `POST` function defines the input validation for the route parameter (:id). We import the t object for `t.Object` and `t.Numeric` from elysia as shown below.

```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from "elysia";
```

This `t.Numeric()` function will automatically try to coerce any string to a number (unsure how safe this actually is, but let's not worry about that in our workshop/proof of concept).  
Now we can update our TodoItem component to send this post request when the input is toggled. When we get the response we want to swap our entire component with this response. Below is the code to achieve this in htmx.

```html
<div id="{id.toString()}" class="flex flex-row space-x-3">
  <p>${content}</p>
  <input type="checkbox" checked={completed} hx-post={`/todos/toggle/${id}`}
  hx-target="closest div" hx-swap="outerHTML" />
  <button class="text-red-500">X</button>
</div>
```

Notice the hx-target and hx-swap parameters.
hx-target can target any dom element using css selectors and other search methods in this case closest div will select the parent div of the input. For more info on hx-target please visit https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-target/.  
hx-swap is set to outerHTML to replace the entire target element with the response. For more information on hx-swap visit https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/  
To test our new code we want to start with a fresh page, then tick off some todos and refresh the page and watch the magic, the todos are still ticked.

#### Delete (because well it is the next in the acronym right?)

To be able to delete we are going to have to add a `DELETE /todos/:id` function to the router (lucky for us this framework is built for humans and not computers, if you don't understand this I am assuming you did not open the elysia webpage).
This change is fairly easy and looks like the code below.

```typescript
.delete(
  "/todos/:id",
  ({ params }) => {
      const todo = db.find((todo => todo.id === params.id));
      if (todo) {
        db.splice(db.indexOf(todo), 1);
      }
  },
  {
    params: t.Object({
      id: t.Numeric(),
    }),
  }
)
```

And now we have to update our component to actually call this `DELETE` method as shown below.

```html
<div id={id.toString()} class="flex flex-row space-x-3">
  <p>${content}</p>
  <input
   type="checkbox"
    checked={completed}
    hx-post={`/todos/toggle/${id}`}
    hx-target="closest div"
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
  />
  <button
    class="text-red-500"
    hx-delete={`/todos/${id}`}
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
    hx-target="closest div">X</button>
</div>
```

This is something different, meaning the `DELETE` method doesn't return an element or anything for that matter. hx-swap actually has a `delete` value we can use, but it does not make sense in this case. We only want to change the element if the call is successful and the `delete` value deletes it whether or not the call is completed successfully.  
By returning an empty response the component actually gets overwritten with nothing (read: empty) and therefor it works like we want only to be deleted if the response actually is correct (meaning nothing in this case).  
Look at http://localhost:3000 and try to delete something in order to get it back we have to reload the whole application (rerun `bun run --watch index.tsx`)

#### Create

Why in gods name would we want to create new todos? I mean the shorter our todo lists get the better right?
We will start with creating a `POST /todos` route to handle the creation of new todos.

```typescript
.post(
  "/todos",
  ({ body }) => {
    if (body.content.length === 0) {
        throw new Error("Content cannot be empty");
    }
    const newTodo = {
        id: lastID++,
        content: body.content,
        completed: false,
    };
    db.push(newTodo);
    return <TodoItem {...newTodo} />;
  },
  {
    body: t.Object({
      content: t.String(),
    }),
  }
)
```

Notice the lastID variable, we don't have that yet. Let's create that just above our database (array) and use the id+1 that you have set last.

```typescript
let lastID = 5;
```

Now on to creating the form component so we can actually add the todo. We can add this to end of our file.

```typescript
function TodoForm() {
  return (
    <form
      class="flex flex-row space-x-3"
      hx-post="/todos"
      hx-swap="beforebegin"
    >
      <input type="text" name="content" class="border border-black" />
      <button type="submit">Add</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Now we also have to add this TodoForm component to our TodoList component so it will always show up at the bottom of the list.

```html
<div>
  {todos.map((todo) => (
  <TodoItem {...todo} />
  ))}
  <TodoForm />
</div>
```

And now we should have full CRUD functionality in our application. Let's test and play around at http://localhost:3000

Notice how if we restart our server everything is reset. For this, we need to introduce a database.

## Database

Well since the state of our application is now reverting to the initial state every time we reset our application we want to add a database. Bun to the rescue again. Bun has built-in SQLite functionality. Let's use it.

### Create database tables and set up script.

We want to move some files around to make sure we can comfortably add more files without everything on the root folder.  
Let's start with creating a src folder.

```bash
mkdir src
```

After this we move our `index.tsx` into this folder. Please don't forget to change the startup command `bun run --watch ./src/index.tsx`.

```bash
mv index.tsx ./src/index.tsx
```

Then we create a db folder inside the `src` folder to hold our database files.

```bash
cd src
mkdir db
```

Let's add some database dependencies. In this case, we are going to use drizzle to connect to our database. Drizzle ORM is a TypeScript ORM for SQL databases designed with maximum type safety in mind. For more information check out https://orm.drizzle.team/.

```bash
bun add drizzle-orm
bun add -d drizzle-kit
```

In the `db` folder we will create the `schema.ts` file with the following content.

```typescript
import { InferSelectModel } from "drizzle-orm";
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const todos = sqliteTable("todos", {
  id: integer("id", { mode: "number" }).primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  content: text("content").notNull(),
  completed: integer("completed", { mode: "boolean" }).notNull().default(false),
});

export type Todo = InferSelectModel<typeof todos>;
```

This is to describe our `todos` table and `todo` type later in our application.

To connect to our database we are creating an `index.ts` file to do so also in the `db` folder with the content below.

```typescript
import { drizzle, BunSQLiteDatabase } from "drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite";
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
import * as schema from "./schema";

const sqlite = new Database("todo.db", { create: true });
sqlite.run(
  "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, content TEXT NOT NULL, completed INTEGER NOT NULL);"
);

export const db: BunSQLiteDatabase = drizzle(sqlite, { schema, logger: true });
```

Here we just setup the database from bun and the file name `todo.db`. We also enable drizzle with the database, schema and logger true (so we can see what the queries are doing).
Also notice the `sqlite run` function to create a table if it does not exists.

### Update src/index.tsx to use our database

Now we need to remove our current database (array) and use the database we have created.

To do this we need to add the imports that we just created.

```typescript
import { todos, Todo } from "./db/schema";
import { db } from "./db";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
```

For actually changing the logic to deal with our database we need to update most of our routes. These routes all need to be using the new database and have queries attached to them. In the end, it will look like the code below.

```typescript
.get("/todos", async () => {
    const data = await db.select().from(todos);
    return <TodoList todos={data} />;
})
.post(
    "/todos/toggle/:id",
    async ({ params }) => {
        const oldTodo = await db
            .select()
            .from(todos)
            .where(eq(todos.id, params.id))

        const newTodo = await db
            .update(todos)
            .set({ completed: !oldTodo?.pop()?.completed })
            .where(eq(todos.id, params.id))
            .returning()

        return <TodoItem {...newTodo.pop()} />;
    },
    {
        params: t.Object({
            id: t.Numeric(),
        }),
    })
.delete(
    "/todos/:id",
    async ({ params }) => {
        await db.delete(todos).where(eq(todos.id, params.id));
    },
    {
        params: t.Object({
            id: t.Numeric(),
        }),
    }
)
.post(
    "/todos",
    async ({ body }) => {
        if (body.content.length === 0) {
            throw new Error("Content cannot be empty");
        }
        const newTodo = await db.insert(todos).values({ content: body.content }).returning();
        return <TodoItem {...newTodo.pop()} />;
    },
    {
        body: t.Object({
            content: t.String(),
        }),
    }
)
```

And don't forget to remove our current database (array) and the inserts for that database. If you don't there will probably be a naming issue where db is already used.
We should now have an application for a todo list that persists through server resets (don't overwrite the database).
Test this at http://localhost:3000/

### Turso

So at the beginning, we talked about what the BETH stack was and so far we missed the T, well not really. Using the builtin SQLite from Bun served us well here. Having said this, I think we should still try it and I will go over the edits needed to connect to Turso.  
I already created a database with an existing table. This means that we will all have a similar view of the state once we all connect. This will bring its own misery (don't delete something that doesn't exist), but we won't fix these here.  
Start with adding new dependencies since we won't be using the bun SQLite drivers but now libsql drivers.

```bash
bun add @libsql/client
```

I am not going to go into creating this database, you can watch the Youtube video for that if you like.
We do need to create some environment variables we can later also use to store as secrets in a pipeline (also in the video not in this course).
Let's create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=GET_THIS_FROM_ME_TO_CONNECT_TO_DB
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=GET_THIS_FROM_ME_FOR_MAGIC
```

We don't have to change the schema, we do have to change our `index.ts` in the db folder. We are connecting using a different driver and library and we are using the earlier created environment variables.

```typescript
import { drizzle, LibSQLDatabase } from "drizzle-orm/libsql";
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";
import * as schema from "./schema";

const client = createClient({
  url: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  authToken: process.env.DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN,
});

export const db: LibSQLDatabase<typeof schema> = drizzle(client, {
  schema,
  logger: true,
});
```

And voila you should now be connecting to the database that was setup earlier and see the items in this todo database on http://localhost:3000
